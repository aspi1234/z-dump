Hey, thanks for dropping by! I'm **Ngatchou Landry**, a c*ybersecurity enthusiast* with a solid foundation in _network_ and _Linux administration_. My journey began with a passion for connecting computers and ensuring they communicate seamlessly (and troubleshooting with a friendly smile when they're being a bit stubborn!). Currently, I'm deeply immersed in expanding my expertise in _Linux system administration_, diving into _system programming_, mastering _web application penetration testing_, and exploring the exciting realm of _application containerization_. While I dabble a bit in _AI_, my curiosity is truly piqued by its security implications and the art of ethical hacking within that space. Away from the keyboard, I enjoy _reading, writing, and hands-on projects_ like _car security modifications_, _DIY creations_, and _electronics work_ (especially soldering!). _Documentaries_ are also a favorite pastime with my favorite being _"how to by john wilson"_.
