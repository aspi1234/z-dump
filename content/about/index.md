"Hi there, I’m Ngatchou. You could say I’m an Information Technology enthusiast, but really, I'm just incredibly curious about how things work.

My journey into IT started with a professional degree in Networking & Telecommunication. But my real education began once I got my hands on the hardware. Dealing with computers and network devices made me intensely curious. I didn't just want to know _how_ they worked; I wanted to know how to make them behave in unintended ways and, most importantly, how to secure them. That feeling—especially the challenge of outsmarting the technology—was a clear sign. I realized my place wasn't just in telecommunication, but in cybersecurity. So, I decided to switch paths and am now studying cybersecurity at the Uba.

As I dove into cybersecurity, I quickly learned that so much of the digital world is built on Linux. That's what sparked my interest in its ecosystem. I went on to earn the Linux Foundation IT Associate certification, and now I'm on the path to becoming a Linux System Administrator by preparing for the LFCS. Of course, theory is one thing, but practice is everything. I sharpen my cybersecurity skills by actively participating in CTFs and on platforms like Hack The Box and pwn.college.

Cybersecurity can be intense, so I find it's important to have other interests to stay balanced. When I’m not in front of a screen, you'll probably find me reading, writing down random thoughts, listening to music (especially old-timers), or watching a good documentary. Lately, my curiosity has also pulled me toward the rise of generative AI, and I'm exploring how LLMs and Machine Learning can be integrated with cybersecurity.

But my interests aren't just digital. I'm also involved in car security. It's a completely different kind of challenge, but I get a lot of satisfaction from helping people regain access to their vehicles by programming new keys.

So, that's me in a nutshell. A cybersecurity student, a Linux enthusiast, and a lifelong learner. Thanks for stopping by to read my story."
